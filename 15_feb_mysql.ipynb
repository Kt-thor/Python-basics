    "Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS); whereas NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database. \n",
    "\n",
    "SQL is one of the most versatile and widely-used options available which makes it a safe choice especially for great complex queries. But from other side it can be restrictive. SQL requires you to use predefined schemas to determine the structure of your data before you work with it. Also all of your data must follow the same structure. This can require significant up-front preparation which means that a change in the structure would be both difficult and disruptive to your whole system. \n",
    "\n",
    "A NoSQL database has dynamic schema for unstructured data. Data is stored in many ways which means it can be document-oriented, column-oriented, graph-based or organized as a KeyValue store. This flexibility means that documents can be created without having defined structure first. "
