    "Abstract base classes provide a way to define interfaces when other techniques like hasattr() would be clumsy or subtly wrong (for example with magic methods). ABCs introduce virtual subclasses, which are classes that donâ€™t inherit from a class but are still recognized by isinstance() and issubclass() functions. There are many built-in ABCs in Python. ABCs for Data structures like Iterator, Generator, Set, mapping etc. are defined in collections.abc module. The numbers module defines numeric tower which is a collection of base classes for numeric data types. The 'abc' module in Python library provides the infrastructure for defining custom abstract base classes.\n",
