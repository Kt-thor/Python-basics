    "Measures of dispersion such as range, variance, and standard deviation are used to describe the spread of a dataset by quantifying how much the data varies from the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the dataset. It provides a quick estimate of the variability of the data, but it is sensitive to extreme values and may not accurately represent the overall spread of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The variance is a more precise measure of the spread of the data, which measures the average of the squared differences from the mean. It is calculated by taking the sum of the squared differences between each data point and the mean, dividing by the total number of data points minus one. A higher variance indicates a wider range of values in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard deviation is the square root of the variance and provides a more easily interpretable measure of the spread of the data. It indicates how far the data values are from the mean. A higher standard deviation indicates that the data points are more spread out from the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the following dataset of daily sales of a store for a week: 120, 135, 145, 125, 130, 140, 150. The mean of the dataset is (120+135+145+125+130+140+150)/7 = 135. The range is 150 - 120 = 30. The variance is [(120-135)^2 + (135-135)^2 + (145-135)^2 + (125-135)^2 + (130-135)^2 + (140-135)^2 + (150-135)^2]/(7-1) = 225. The standard deviation is the square root of the variance, which is √225 = 15. These measures indicate that the data is not highly variable, and the values are mostly close to the mean."
