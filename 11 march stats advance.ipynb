This is because larger samples are more representative of the population, and therefore provide a more precise estimate of the population parameter. Second, as the sample size increases, the critical value decreases, which also leads to a smaller margin of error.

    "Since the calculated t-value (0) is within the range of the critical t-values (-1.699 to 1.699), we fail to reject the null hypothesis. Therefore, we cannot conclude that caffeine has a significant effect on reaction time at a 90% confidence level."
